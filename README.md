Projects I made back in 2014 to get my feet wet. Emailed Terry Cavanagh and he suggested just jumping in with Flixel or Flashpunk. Really inspiring to get a response from someone who made the famous Super Hexagon, game I loved. 

These projects suck haha DuckStory3 is the most complete. 

I've since moved on to LOVE2D for gameprototyping but these were great first steps.
